# Webkit 

## What am I looking at?

You are looking at the node webkit browser that powers [phpbrowserbox](http://www.africoders.com/forum/phpbrowserbox). You can download the [full app here](https://sourceforge.net/p/phpbrowserbox/).

## Features
 * It allows developer to use node commands inside the frontend aspect of the project that they develop.
 * It allows modification of the main browser component in terms of look and feel.
 * It allows changing of the default icon of the phpbrowserbox icon when application is started.

If you looking for the core phpbrowserbox source code (excluding the webkit browser), please [check here](https://github.com/dhtml/phpbrowserbox).

## Installation and Usage

One of the main goals of phpbrowserbox is that the browser component needs to be flexible.

The icon that is displayed when the browserbox starts is the app.png inside this package.

[Download the archive](https://github.com/dhtml/webkit/archive/master.zip) and simply modify it, then repackage it as webkit.exe.
Then copy the webkit.exe and its dependencies into the support/webkit folder of your phpbrowserbox.

And that should be it.
